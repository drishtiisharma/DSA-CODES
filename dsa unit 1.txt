Under **Algorithm Analysis**, the following topics should be explained:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Definition and purpose
   - Best, worst, and average-case scenarios
   - Common time complexities (e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2))

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Definition and purpose
   - Measurement of auxiliary space
   - Comparison with time complexity

3. **Cost Estimation of Data Structure Operations**:
   - Analysis of basic operations (insert, delete, search)
   - Impact of data structure choice on performance

4. **Asymptotic Notations**:
   - Big O notation (O())
   - Big Theta notation (Θ())
   - Big Omega notation (Ω())
   - Understanding and interpreting growth rates
